Trough to develop in the East turning the pattern to a normal to below =\\nnormal temperature regime.   We are looking at a deep trough in the West an=\\nd strong ridge in the East on this mornings weather maps. Dozens of record =\\nhighs were set this weekend from the Plains eastward while it was cold enou=\\ngh in the NW for snow in Seattle. Things are on the move now which should e=\\nnd the warmth for most areas by the end of the week. Relative to recent wee=\\nks, it certainly looks a lot colder, but when one considers the time of yea=\\nr and steps back, well most areas just don't get that cold. This looks to m=\\ne to be the type of situation where it will be colder in the Plains and the=\\nn modify as it heads East. This has a similar feel to what happened in lat!=\\n e December. At the moment, we are devoid of snow cover, so I have a diffic=\\nult time getting too pumped up over all of this. Speaking of snow, the West=\\nern U.S. system may produce some moderate snows over the far North and Lake=\\ns as it pushes from the High Plains NE to Canada.

If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. \\n\\n2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name.

Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to =\\nreload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecas=\\nt understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the=\\n snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European e=\\nnough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its t=\\nransient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day n=\\numbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many=\\n ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the larg=\\nest departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an acti=\\nve storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of so=\\nuth! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northe=\\nrn Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the ne=\\nxt couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later=\\n in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on =\\nthe next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. =\\nWhile its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the =\\nWest. That does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is tr=\\napped in much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to sc=\\nour this out.

But there is somethin=\\ng you can do to help guarantee your success this  semester -- subscribe to =\\n Questia.    Why subscribe?  Think about the price tag of just getting into=\\n school -- tuition, books, etc. You've made  a huge investment, but getting=\\n into school doesn't guarantee academic success. Questia, on the other hand=\\n, at  a much more affordable price tag  actually  will help you achieve suc=\\ncess. So really, the only question is why wouldn't you subscribe?   The pri=\\nce of a book  Questia gives you a library in your room that's  available ar=\\nound the clock -- 24/7.    And you won't find our exclusive collection anyw=\\nhere else on the Internet.

I had taken an \"old\" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought a=\\nlong a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out af=\\nter watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and=\\n meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we=\\n returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He =\\nreplied,  \"You don't know how.\" Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  cha=\\nllenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I h=\\nad to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I=\\n said, \"I'll  learn.\" And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me=\\n  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and=\\n ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my =\\nbelt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one aro=\\nund yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river, =\\n silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All a=\\nlone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I trul=\\ny enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys=\\n. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmical=\\nly on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now,=\\n in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  An=\\nd the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fi=\\nshing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and li=\\nke a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  cre=\\nek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still jus=\\nt with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for ca=\\ntching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big t=\\nrout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing =\\nto me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had s=\\ntarted out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice in=\\nstead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing\\npping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It mea=\\nns I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing=\\n. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that=\\n pushes me further along and there is  always something new to learn.

Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be w=\\ninters final gasp.   I don't believe I hype storms as much as many forecast=\\ners, but the current storm now forming in the Plains deserves some attentio=\\nn. Some serious snow and ice accumulations are possible from Oklahoma NE to=\\n Wisconsin and eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall =\\nin the warm sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the E=\\nast with signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has =\\nmy attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the col=\\nd sector of the storm and thats the first time this winter the models have =\\nunderdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not look=\\ning for an! ything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late Janua=\\nry and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern while te=\\nmporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event looks to =\\nreload again in the medium range. The short term temperatures still reflect=\\n the heat in front of this winter storm, so most of the East is still above=\\n normal while the West is below.

First, we could briefly turn on th=\\ne \"Lake Effect\" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. Th=\\nis should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event=\\n, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in be=\\nhind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active o=\\nnce again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next =\\nweek and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see =\\nthis 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certai=\\nnly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit bel=\\now normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models =\\njust past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be p=\\noised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as l=\\nikely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some =\\nmerit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indi=\\nces(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10=\\n days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not b=\\ne an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come =\\ndown the second week of February.        Day 6\\nClick Here  for Syncrasy's 6-10 summary information.

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\\n\\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\\n\\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\\n\\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \\n\\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\\n\\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\\n\\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\\n\\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us.

A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =\\nCentral Plains.

There is not a big snow cover on the gro=\\nund, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=\\nada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=\\nsitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a \"Clippe=\\nr Type\" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can somet=\\nimes be more prodigious snow makers than the big \"Plains type\" counterpart =\\nwe are currently seeing.

The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Conference and associated  Workshops can be obtained by  clicking on the link below\\n \\n\\nElectricity  Market Design Conference\\n \\nMarch  25-26, 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n \\nThis Conference will focus on how to design  competitive electricity markets that maximize the benefits to consumers while at  the same time maintaining the financial viability of companies participating in  these markets.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Electricity Market Design  Conference, March 25-26, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link  below\\n \\n\\nPower  Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference\\n \\nMarch  26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n \\n\\nThis conference will highlight the commonalties and  common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the  enterprise.  The conference will  emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management  processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing  process.  The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading \u0026 marketing departments. The purpose is to  show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in  order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset  owner.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Power Generation Asset and  Portfolio Management Conference,  March 26-28, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by  clicking on the link below\\n http\\n \\n \\n\\nAncillary  Services Conference\\n \\nApril  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n \\nAs more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. \\n \\nThis conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Ancillary Services  Conference, April 10-12, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link  below\\n \\nPlease print the brochure and fax the registration  form back to us at 303-741-0849 if you would like to attend any of these events.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\\n\\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will\\n\\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\\n\\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions\\n\\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups\\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\\n\\nTraders and Originators\\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\\n\\nInformation Technology\\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\\n\\n\\nNext steps \\n\\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \\n\\n\\nRegards,\\nDave Forster\\n713.853.1861\\nE-Mail"},{"Message_ID":"

More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.\\n\\nThe market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker\\n\\nAs a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.\\n\\nPeak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\\n\\n\\nStaffing and Services\\n\\nTrading\\nOn the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\\n\\nOrigination\\nThis is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  \\n\\nIT\\nImplementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \\n\\nLet's get on these issues as soon as possible.\\n\\nOn specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. \\n\\nOffice Space\\nTembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, \u0026 kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\\n\\nPotential Conflict of Interest\\nI would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power \u0026 gas curves should be restricted.\\n\\nAs time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. \\n\\nThank you\\nGarrett\\n\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c8320359.1075842026033.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 9 Jan 2002 08","From":" carol.moline@powerpool.ab.ca","To":" slfr@chevrontexaco.com","Subject":" Power Pool","Cc":" john.zufferli@enron.com","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":" john.zufferli@enron.com","X_From":" \"carol.moline@powerpool.ab.ca\" \u003ccarol.moline@powerpool.ab.ca\u003e@ENRON","X_To":" slfr@chevrontexaco.com","X_cc":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e, astrid.montes@powerpool.ab.ca, karen.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Inbox","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nThis email is acknowledgement from the Power Pool of Alberta of the change\\nin direct sales/forward contract registration for contracts that are\\ncurrently registered with the Power Pool between Chevron Canada Resources\\nand Enron Canada Power Corporation for trading after December 29 HE 1 2001.\\nOn January 4 the Power Pool received your acknowledgement of Enron's change\\nin the source asset for the direct sales/forward contract registrations for\\ncontract # 1947 to modify the source from the Sundance 3 unit (SD3) to\\nEnron's unmetered source asset (ECP-).

Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. \\nThe suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. \\nCNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee.

I hadn't spoken to  him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.  I only  hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer. \\nSome of the  other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they  said that they were going to be evacuated.  None of the 36 people who  worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of  Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive. \\nWe are all in a state  of shock and disbelief.  Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.  He was  the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and  respectful person I have ever known.  He never had a bad word to say about  anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.  The children and I, (5), feel  like our lives ended that same day.  I can't imagine moving on or ever  being happy again.  There is no reason for this dispicable act...this world  will never be the same. \\nThere were many articles about Chris in various  papers here in NJ and NY.  I was also on CNN when we were searching for  him.  You can find these at the Starledger.com, NYtimes.com, the Stamford  Advocate, Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa.com website.  I have set  up a trust fund for the children if you are interested.  The address is The  Christopher Wodenshek Children's Trust c/o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court  Street Hackensack, NJ. \\nI am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris,  but that sounds familiar to me.

The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c25780742.1075842035796.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 25 Jun 2001 12","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" john.postlethwaite@enron.com","Subject":" RE","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Postlethwaite, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jpostle\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nI just need the positions aggregated, I don't need the desks broken out\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c8558458.1075842035822.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 25 Jun 2001 07","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" p..messenger@enron.com","Subject":" FW","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" quoted-printable","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Messenger, John P. \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmessen2\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n an\td 2003 -200X Meeting\\n\\n\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c27708908.1075842036020.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 25 Jun 2001 06","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jzufferli@home.com","Subject":" FW","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'jzufferli@home.com'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c1668637.1075842036103.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 25 Jun 2001 06","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" wconwell@rr.com","Subject":" RE","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'wendy' \u003cwconwell@rr.com\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nFinancial settlement occurs between Enron and the customer.

Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P\u0026L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P\u0026L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.\\n\\nIt is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.

I hit lactate threshold fairly quick.\\n\\nThanks"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c16498082.1075842029389.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 21 Dec 2001 12","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" mark.dupuy@enron.com","Subject":" RE","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Dupuy, Mark \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mdupuy\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nyes\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c22995838.1075842029414.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 21 Dec 2001 12","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" karen.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca","Subject":" RE","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'karen.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca@ENRON'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nIts OK\\n\\nJohn Zufferli\\n"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c11108760.1075842029437.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 21 Dec 2001 12","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" karen.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca","Subject":" Lethbrige Ironworks","Cc":" katrina@valeopower.com","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":" katrina@valeopower.com","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'karen.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca'","X_cc":" 'katrina@valeopower.com'","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nyou can increase the direct sale to include Dec 31, 2001\\n\\nThank you \\n\\nJohn Zufferli"},{"Message_ID":" \u003c8076849.1075842029460.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 21 Dec 2001 09","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" livia_zufferli@monitor.com","Subject":" RE","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'Livia_Zufferli@Monitor.com@ENRON'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nYou should talk to Jess about that, she is due March 2 but I am not sure when her mom is coming and going.
