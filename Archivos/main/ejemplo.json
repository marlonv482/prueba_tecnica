This investment boom and the\\nsubsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic\\nexpectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's\\ndevelopment.\\n\\n*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market\\nduring the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the\\ntelecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'\\nconfidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the\\npace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.\\n\\n*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long\\nrun the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater\\nmaturity among companies and their backers.\\n\\n*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies\\nand drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will\\nbecome an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the\\nfuture.\\n\\n**end**\\n\\nFollow above URL for complete Private Report (16 printed pages).\\n\\n\\n\\nE-mail Category: Private Report\\nCERA Knowledge Area(s): Distributed Energy\\n\\n\\n\\n*****************************************************************************************\\nCERAWeek2002 - February 11-15, 2002 - 21st Annual Executive Conference and\\nRelated Events REGISTER ONLINE TODAY AT:  http://www.cera.com/ceraweek\\n** Two- and Four-day Passes Available\\n** Special Enrollment Programs\\n** Partnership Opportunities\\n** CERAWeek Online Premium Access\\n*****************************************************************************************\\n\\n\\nTo make changes to your cera.com profile go to:\\nhttp://www.cera.com/client/updateaccount\\n\\nForgot your username and password?

Trough to develop in the East turning the pattern to a normal to below =\\nnormal temperature regime.   We are looking at a deep trough in the West an=\\nd strong ridge in the East on this mornings weather maps. Dozens of record =\\nhighs were set this weekend from the Plains eastward while it was cold enou=\\ngh in the NW for snow in Seattle. Things are on the move now which should e=\\nnd the warmth for most areas by the end of the week. Relative to recent wee=\\nks, it certainly looks a lot colder, but when one considers the time of yea=\\nr and steps back, well most areas just don't get that cold. This looks to m=\\ne to be the type of situation where it will be colder in the Plains and the=\\nn modify as it heads East. This has a similar feel to what happened in lat!=\\n e December. At the moment, we are devoid of snow cover, so I have a diffic=\\nult time getting too pumped up over all of this. Speaking of snow, the West=\\nern U.S. system may produce some moderate snows over the far North and Lake=\\ns as it pushes from the High Plains NE to Canada. This does not appear to b=\\ne a situation that favors any East Coast winter storm development. Short te=\\nrm numbers will still show warmth in the East, but that is a function of th=\\ne next couple of days. The Western and Central U.S. temperature departures =\\nare already below normal and that trend will shift East later this week.   =\\n Tomorrow: Tuesday, January 29, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

The SE ridge is replaced by a trough i=\\nn the means so we should not see the recent spring regime. The trend over t=\\nhe Western part of the continent ( US and Canada) is for Pacific zonal flow=\\n. The real bitter cold that has been in Canada the last several weeks shoul=\\nd gradually modify. We will likely see two distinct branches in the jet str=\\neam, an arctic branch in the North and subtropical branch in the South. We =\\nget our big storms and bitter cold outbreaks when they phase(come together)=\\n. Most of the extreme forecasts you see come together when this phasing occ=\\nurs. I can not rule it out in the future, but it looks unlikely to me for n=\\now. To me, the bottom line for this period(and beyond)is for a slight cold =\\nbias East and a close to normal look elsewhere.!

If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. \\n\\n2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name.

We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last=\\n month. January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable war=\\nmth in the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record b=\\nreaking cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal=\\n over the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I=\\n still don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a \"cold an=\\nd stormy\" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this =\\nmorning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas =\\ntoday with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast thro=\\nugh Th! ursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see som=\\ne light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker. This=\\n should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The coldes=\\nt of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now.

The Canadian and E=\\nuropean schemes still look sharper with the western ridge and eastern troug=\\nh than their American counterpart. The correct forecast up to now most of t=\\nhe time was to go with the warmer solution. This time I am running with the=\\n colder one. The Canadian model has been consistent with a stronger Eastern=\\n trough since the middle of last week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic=\\n air next week into the Eastern U.S. The potential of some sort of East coa=\\nst storm also remains in this pattern. I am not by any means forecasting an=\\ny brutal cold, but I am going against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlo=\\noks which are above normal in the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region=\\n will grade out slightly below normal instead while th! e West is in a mode=\\nrating phase.

Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to =\\nreload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecas=\\nt understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the=\\n snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European e=\\nnough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its t=\\nransient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day n=\\numbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many=\\n ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the larg=\\nest departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an acti=\\nve storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of so=\\nuth! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northe=\\nrn Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the ne=\\nxt couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later=\\n in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on =\\nthe next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. =\\nWhile its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the =\\nWest.

I =\\nstill dont see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the SE ridge =\\nthat has been in place for much of January is no more. In all cases, the mo=\\ndels suppress the storm track to the Southern U.S. which opens the door to =\\nanother potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther South than =\\nthe last one. The solutions are all over the place which one would expect t=\\nhis far out. One aspect that struck me as noteworthy was the Canadian's dep=\\niction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has had it for thre=\\ne runs in a row, but given the high surface pressures does not look as cold=\\n as I would have expected. It's just another product of a strange winter I =\\nsuspect. So, while I still am not in any kind of arctic camp on this, I do =\\nbe! lieve the areas of above normal temperatures will be very limited.

I had taken an \"old\" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought a=\\nlong a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out af=\\nter watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and=\\n meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we=\\n returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He =\\nreplied,  \"You don't know how.\" Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  cha=\\nllenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I h=\\nad to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I=\\n said, \"I'll  learn.\" And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me=\\n  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and=\\n ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my =\\nbelt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one aro=\\nund yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river, =\\n silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All a=\\nlone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I trul=\\ny enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys=\\n. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmical=\\nly on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now,=\\n in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  An=\\nd the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fi=\\nshing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and li=\\nke a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  cre=\\nek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still jus=\\nt with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for ca=\\ntching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big t=\\nrout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing =\\nto me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had s=\\ntarted out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice in=\\nstead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing: sharing tips, swa=\\npping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It mea=\\nns I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing=\\n. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that=\\n pushes me further along and there is  always something new to learn.  BIO =\\nKourtney  Morgan works as a sample maker for Patagonia where she began  fly=\\n fishing. Reflecting on the sport, she says, \"I do so many  things I can't =\\nsay which is my favorite. I will say this, they  all have one thing in comm=\\non, I do them with joy and reckless  abandon.\" [IMAGE]  Photo: Yvon Chouina=\\nrd [IMAGE]     Free Catalog  | Shopping Cart  | Privacy/Security  |  Email =\\nSign Up  Contact Us  | Jobs  | Affiliate Info  | Your Account  | Customer  =\\nService  Site Map  | Home    Call us anytime  1.800.638.6464   ? 2002 Patag=\\nonia,  Inc.

Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be w=\\ninters final gasp.   I don't believe I hype storms as much as many forecast=\\ners, but the current storm now forming in the Plains deserves some attentio=\\nn. Some serious snow and ice accumulations are possible from Oklahoma NE to=\\n Wisconsin and eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall =\\nin the warm sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the E=\\nast with signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has =\\nmy attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the col=\\nd sector of the storm and thats the first time this winter the models have =\\nunderdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not look=\\ning for an! ything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late Janua=\\nry and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern while te=\\nmporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event looks to =\\nreload again in the medium range.

First, we could briefly turn on th=\\ne \"Lake Effect\" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. Th=\\nis should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event=\\n, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in be=\\nhind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active o=\\nnce again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next =\\nweek and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see =\\nthis 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certai=\\nnly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit bel=\\now normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models =\\njust past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be p=\\noised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as l=\\nikely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some =\\nmerit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indi=\\nces(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10=\\n days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not b=\\ne an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come =\\ndown the second week of February.

The lack o=\\nf realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again the air simply is n=\\not that frigid. We are still below normal relative to normal over much of t=\\nhe South and West. In the West, it is due to high pressure trapped in the I=\\nntermountain region while in the South it is in response to inclement weath=\\ner along the storm track. The North and East are back into a warming mode i=\\nn spite of the fact that a trough will reform in the East. Upstream over th=\\ne Western h! alf of Canada, it is just not that cold anymore. The MRF is up=\\n to its old tricks of a sharp cooling \"just past this period\" and the Canad=\\nian still insists on a moderate intensity high coming down this weekend.

The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.\\n\\nFirst, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.\\n\\nThe Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.\\n\\nSteve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  \\n\\nAs you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.\\n\\nIn addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.\\n\\nWe will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.\\n\\nThank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.\\n\\nLink to the press release: http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2002/ene/012902Release.html\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/deleted_items/91.","Message_ID":" \u003c24261603.1075842023629.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 29 Jan 2002 07:24:29 -0800 (PST)","From":" announcements.enron@enron.com","To":" dl-ga-canada_calgary@enron.com, dl-ga-canada_ees_calgary@enron.com, :\tdl-ga-canada_ees_toronto@enron.com, dl-ga-canada_toronto@enron.com, :\tdl-ga-canada_enrondirect_toronto@enron.com, :\tdl-ga-canada_enrondirect_calgary@enron.com","Subject":"  EXTRA!

T=\\nhis storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in=\\n terms of cold.  A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the =\\nCentral Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and =\\nrecord warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southe=\\nrn Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of wint=\\ner weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois=\\n. More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the=\\n week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significan=\\nt freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas t=\\no just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain=\\n ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse=\\n the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly =\\nexpect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the eart=\\nh shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have tren=\\nded warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap =\\nfrom, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what =\\nwe saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that=\\n has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above n=\\normal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but it sho=\\nuld not be as cold as the last couple of days.

There is not a big snow cover on the gro=\\nund, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Can=\\nada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight po=\\nsitive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a \"Clippe=\\nr Type\" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can somet=\\nimes be more prodigious snow makers than the big \"Plains type\" counterpart =\\nwe are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the =\\nLakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to predict this far ou=\\nt. Other than this system, I don't see much action in the 6-10 day period. =\\nHoweve! r, there is some potential for another storm to emerge out of the S=\\nW just after this.

The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Conference and associated  Workshops can be obtained by  clicking on the link below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/trans_expn.pdf \\n \\n\\nElectricity  Market Design Conference\\n \\nMarch  25-26, 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n \\nThis Conference will focus on how to design  competitive electricity markets that maximize the benefits to consumers while at  the same time maintaining the financial viability of companies participating in  these markets.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Electricity Market Design  Conference, March 25-26, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by clicking on the link  below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/MrktDesgn.pdf \\n \\n\\nPower  Generation Asset and Portfolio Management Conference\\n \\nMarch  26-28 2002, Atlanta, Georgia\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n \\n\\nThis conference will highlight the commonalties and  common applications between the asset management processes used throughout the  enterprise.  The conference will  emphasize the need to link the physical power generation asset management  processes to the activities and processes of the trading and marketing  process.  The processes of Asset  management will be addressed from three distinct perspectives, first, the  long-term perspective of portfolio developers, second the more medium term  perspective of maintenance/system planners and third the conference will link  short term issues of the trading \u0026 marketing departments. The purpose is to  show how these processes can be integrated to the individual assets (plants) in  order to provide consistent and profitable strategies for the generation asset  owner.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Power Generation Asset and  Portfolio Management Conference,  March 26-28, 2002, Wyndham Hotel Downtown, Atlanta, GA can be obtained by  clicking on the link below:\\n http://www.euci.com/pdf/powergeneration.pdf \\n \\n \\n\\nAncillary  Services Conference\\n \\nApril  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado\\n \\nOVERVIEW\\n\\n \\nAs more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. \\n \\nThis conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.\\n \\nThe brochure for the Ancillary Services  Conference, April 10-12, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link  below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf \\n \\nPlease print the brochure and fax the registration  form back to us at 303-741-0849 if you would like to attend any of these events.

This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  \\n\\nThe general marketing plan is as follows:\\n- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy\\n- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week\\n- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate\\n- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)\\n- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval\\n\\nThe attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.

It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.\\n\\nPurpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our \"live\" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:\\n\\nTest the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)\\nProvide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup\\nDemonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week\\n\\nNature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:\\n\\nCredit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:\\nProfile tests for \"external\" customers (role-played by Originators)\\nProfile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)\\nData and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems\\n\\nTraders and Originators:\\nTraders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.\\nOriginators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.\\n\\nInformation Technology:\\nWill assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.\\nAfter the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books\\nWill ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.\\n\\n\\nNext steps \\n\\nTraders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.\\nOriginators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.\\nUBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.\\n\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861). \\n\\n\\nRegards,\\nDave

As Cowan says, potentially the bonus pool may be much bigger next year, which is great, but it's not for sure. And given the promises Enron has dolled out over the years, it doesn't mean that much right now, especially considering it's in UBS's best interest for us not to make a killing in the first year in order to buy out the company at a lower price.\\n\\nThanks,\\nRyan\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/inbox/30.","Message_ID":" \u003c180130.1075842025752.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 29 Jan 2002 09:22:46 -0800 (PST)","From":" mark.dupuy@enron.com","To":" john.zufferli@enron.com, robert.hemstock@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Proposed Pool Code Changes January 28, 2002","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain;

This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.\\n\\nThe Splash page will look something like the following:\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nWeek of Feb. 4:\\n\\nWe will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.\\n\\nWeek of Feb. 11:\\n\\nThe site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). \\n\\nGeneral Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.\\n\t\t\\n\\nTrading/Origination Coordination\\n\\nThe Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.\\n\\n\\nUBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:\\n\\nFor Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).\t\t\\n\\nTeresa Mandola (39807) - Power\\nJennifer McQuade (53614) - Power\\nDan Diamond (39673) - Gas\\n\\n\\n\u003cEmbedded Picture (Metafile)\u003e\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/inbox/35.","Message_ID":" \u003c10770334.1075842025938.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 28 Jan 2002 12:31:53 -0800 (PST)","From":" garrett.tripp@enron.com","To":" john.zufferli@enron.com, rob.milnthorp@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Ontario overview","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Tripp, Garrett \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=GTRIPP\u003e","X_To":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jzuffer\u003e, Milnthorp, Rob \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rmilnth\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Inbox","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nPlease disregard the Hydro slide (p.12 or 13) in the Presentation.

More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.\\n\\nThe market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  \\n\\nAs a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.\\n\\nPeak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\\n\\n\\nStaffing and Services\\n\\nTrading\\nOn the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\\n\\nOrigination\\nThis is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  \\n\\nIT\\nImplementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \\n\\nLet's get on these issues as soon as possible.\\n\\nOn specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. \\n\\nOffice Space\\nTembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, \u0026 kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\\n\\nPotential Conflict of Interest\\nI would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power \u0026 gas curves should be restricted.\\n\\nAs time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. \\n\\nThank you\\nGarrett\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tMilnthorp, Rob  \\nSent:\tWednesday, January 16, 2002 6:53 PM\\nTo:\tTripp, Garrett\\nSubject:\tRE: Ontario Update\\n\\nGarrett, I take that these are your mids.

Internet fees are reimbursed through payroll with the final processing date being December 15th .  Below are the simple steps to claim your Internet fees  up to December 31, 2001 :\\n\\n(1)  Enter your Internet payment information on the \"Clickathome.enron.com/canada\" site.  This initially registers you as an Internet user in the ClickAtHome Canada program and then provides the appropriate information to our accounting department for payment.   You can include your Internet fees from the commencement of the program (June 5, 2001) or for pilot program participants from your commencement date to December 31, 2001. \\n\\n(2)  Please complete the first step by  December 15th so your claim can be processed and paid on  December 30th through payroll.   \\n\\n(3)  Kindly retain a copy of all your claimed receipts as back-up in the event you are asked by Calgary Accounting to provide it. \\n\\n** Can't remember your SAP number??  Use this handy site:  \u003chttp://isc.enron.com\u003e (follow the instructions for 'SAP or eHRonline password reset' and then 'click here if you have forgotten your personnel number').   Use your SIN number where it asks for Social Security Number and your all set.\\n\\nIf you need assistance with your registration or have questions about your Internet subsidy, kindly contact  Tricia Henry. \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/102.","Message_ID":" \u003c5843772.1075842030107.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 20 Nov 2001 08:24:43 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" cooper.richey@enron.com","Subject":" FW:","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Richey, Cooper \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Crichey\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tGupta, Gautam  \\nSent:\tTuesday, November 20, 2001 9:11 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\t\\n\\n  \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/104.","Message_ID":" \u003c20130699.1075842030153.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 19 Nov 2001 09:30:09 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" derek.davies@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Alberta PPA","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Davies, Derek \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddavies\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nto this spreadsheet we should add the $64MM cost for increased operating reserves, the $60MM for taxes and fx\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tDavies, Derek  \\nSent:\tMonday, November 19, 2001 10:05 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tFW: Alberta PPA\\n\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tDavies, Derek  \\nSent:\tFriday, November 16, 2001 5:26 PM\\nTo:\tKitchen, Louise; Milnthorp, Rob\\nCc:\t'derek-davies@shaw.ca'\\nSubject:\tAlberta PPA\\n\\nLouise,\\n\\nAttachment as per your conversation with Rob Milnthorp.\\n\\n \u003c\u003c File: LAVO P\u0026L_nov15.xls \u003e\u003e \\n\\nENRON CANADA CORP.\\n\\n\\nDerek J.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.\\n\\nRegards, Nella \\n\\nPS:  I would suggest that anyone who has already booked their flights to cancel same. \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/162.","Message_ID":" \u003c9734229.1075842031506.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 16 Oct 2001 12:55:09 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" nella.cappelletto@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Final 3Q Management Summary and Hot List","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Cappelletto, Nella \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ncappel\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nLooks ok to me from the trading side\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tCappelletto, Nella  \\nSent:\tMonday, October 15, 2001 10:43 AM\\nTo:\tDavies, Derek; Devries, Paul; Kitagawa, Kyle; Le Dain, Eric; Zufferli, John\\nSubject:\tFW: Final 3Q Management Summary and Hot List\\n\\nGentlemen, attached are the recent Enron Americas Management Summary Reports and Hot List for your review.\\n\\nRegards, Nella\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tDay, Misti  \\nSent:\tFriday, October 12, 2001 4:46 PM\\nTo:\tMilnthorp, Rob; Patterson, Grant; Hanslip, David\\nCc:\tOrellana, Richard; Cappelletto, Nella\\nSubject:\tFinal 3Q Management Summary and Hot List\\n\\nPlease find attached the final Management Summary and Hot List for 3rd quarter.\\n\\nThanks\\nMisti\\nx39525\\n\\n \u003c\u003c File: MgmtSum-3Q_2001_0928-FINAL.xls \u003e\u003e  \u003c\u003c File: Hot List 0928.xls \u003e\u003e \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/163.","Message_ID":" \u003c25339545.1075842031529.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 16 Oct 2001 09:14:46 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" rob.milnthorp@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Competition","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Milnthorp, Rob \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rmilnth\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nI agree, I feel the same.

I hadn't spoken to  him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.  I only  hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer. \\nSome of the  other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they  said that they were going to be evacuated.  None of the 36 people who  worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of  Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive. \\nWe are all in a state  of shock and disbelief.  Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.  He was  the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and  respectful person I have ever known.  He never had a bad word to say about  anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.  The children and I, (5), feel  like our lives ended that same day.  I can't imagine moving on or ever  being happy again.  There is no reason for this dispicable act...this world  will never be the same. \\nThere were many articles about Chris in various  papers here in NJ and NY.  I was also on CNN when we were searching for  him.  You can find these at the Starledger.com, NYtimes.com, the Stamford  Advocate, Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa.com website.  I have set  up a trust fund for the children if you are interested.  The address is The  Christopher Wodenshek Children's Trust c/o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court  Street Hackensack, NJ. \\nI am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris,  but that sounds familiar to me.  If so, I wanted to let him know the Ted  Mahoney ( or Maloney?) was also at Cantor and is also amoung the missing.    \\nThanks again for your kind card and prayers.  Please continue to  pray for peace in our and our children's time! \\nFondly, \\nAnne, Sarah,  Haley, Mollie, WIll and Zachy Wodenshek \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/175.","Message_ID":" \u003c17101555.1075842031813.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 8 Oct 2001 06:34:34 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" kate.panchuk@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Costing of Shahnoor Lalani","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Panchuk, Kate \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kpanchuk\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nThis is correct, except that a significant portion of his cost should be reapplied to Enron Direct\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tPanchuk, Kate  \\nSent:\tFriday, October 05, 2001 3:18 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John; Davies, Derek\\nSubject:\tCosting of Shahnoor Lalani\\n\\n\\nI am just wanting to confirm information I received from Tricia Henry earlier this week -  that Sean Lalani should be getting charged to Cost Center 107083 - Power Trading.\\n\\nTo date he has been costed to 150156 - Power Originations.\\n\\nPlease advise whether it is correct to reclass all previous transactions to 107083.\\n\\nThanks\\nKate Panchuk\\nEnron Canada Corp\\nPh: (403) 974 6798\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/176.","Message_ID":" \u003c32134655.1075842031837.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 5 Oct 2001 06:45:12 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jzufferli@home.com","Subject":" FW: Important Information About Security \u0026 ClickAtHome","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'jzufferli@home.com'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tEnron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of ClickAtHome@ENRON\\nSent:\tFriday, October 05, 2001 1:17 AM\\nTo:\tClickathome Participants@ENRON\\nSubject:\tImportant Information About Security \u0026 ClickAtHome\\n\\n\\nDear ClickAtHome Participant,\\n\\nClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.

My original position on the matter has not changed. That is, the wholesale desks need to show a wholesale offer to retail. In other words, the offer shown to our retail affiliate, at a minimum, should equal the offer that would be shown in our wholesale business (either through EOL, brokers or the offer given to originators for wholesale customer deals). \\n\\nThere has been a great deal of discussion with respect to the margins retail is adding to the wholesale offer. From a wholesale perspective, this is irrelevant. The retail business requires large margins due to its nature - small vol, high credit, commission, call centre, invoicing, etc. \\n\\nThe retail margin only becomes relevant if prices need to be tighter. In those particular cases, both parties need to work together to make sure that our price is ultimately competitive. This may involve one or both parties reducing their imbedded margins and/or offer. \\n\\nI am looking to the two of you to help build the retail business. Your leadership and assistance are crititcal to the success of the retail initiative. Without your cooperation, the business is dead. You are both in a position of power to make or break the retail business in Canada. It is very clear that EES Houston is relying heavily on Lavo and his folks to push forward the retail business in the US - it seems to be working. We need to ensure that we are doing the same. I can guarantee you that your efforts will not go unnoticed. \\n\\nI understand that sharing the margin was discussed as an option. This option will not work. From an external perspective, it is imperative that Enron demonstrate its retail capabilities as well as retail earnings. If a portion of retail margin remains in wholesale, it does nothing for expanding the stock multiple. I am convinced that the key lever to expanding our stock multiple lies with retail and therefore retail earnings.\\n\\nIf you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to discuss this further - at the end of the day, it is imperative that we are all on the same page. \\n\\nRegards\\nRob\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/179.","Message_ID":" \u003c6986261.1075842031924.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 3 Oct 2001 15:09:38 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" quen.tan@powerpool.ab.ca","Subject":" RE: ADAMS","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'Quen Tan \u003cquen.tan@powerpool.ab.ca\u003e@ENRON'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\nThe import/export units are fine, here is the SD3 SD4 info\\n\\n\\n - EnronCanada_ENBC.doc \u003c\u003c File: EnronCanada_ENBC.doc \u003e\u003e \\n - EnronCanada_ENE1.doc \u003c\u003c File: EnronCanada_ENE1.doc \u003e\u003e \\n - EnronCanada_ENE2.doc \u003c\u003c File: EnronCanada_ENE2.doc \u003e\u003e \\n - EnronCanada_ENSK.doc \u003c\u003c File: EnronCanada_ENSK.doc \u003e\u003e \\n   \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/18.","Message_ID":" \u003c30601221.1075842027982.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Thu, 31 Jan 2002 14:07:19 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" frank.hayden@enron.com","Subject":" var limit","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Hayden, Frank \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Fhayden\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nFrank, I forgot about Lon Draper and the options, here is an update.\\n\\n \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/180.","Message_ID":" \u003c11131113.1075842031947.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 3 Oct 2001 13:42:09 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jzufferli@home.com","Subject":" RE: Martin - Dish","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" '\"J\u0026J Zufferli\" \u003cjzufferli@home.com\u003e@ENRON'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nI'll call him, I have to arrange to be there when he can come since it requires me to lift the TV with him.\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"J\u0026J Zufferli\" \u003cjzufferli@home.com\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tWednesday, October 03, 2001 10:42 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tMartin - Dish\\n\\n\\nHe called this morning to arrange a time to deliver  that last piece.

My times at Enron have been beyond the expectations that I had when I stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night  when  I first became an Enron analyst.  Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.  \\n\\nEven though I contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years, I never left for another company.  I came to realize that the people that work here are the best, and I have always strived to be among the best.  Aside from the professional skills and energy, the people here have become good friends of mine.   Enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Jim Fallon, Jeff Golden, Mark Muller, Dave Delainey, Kevin Presto, and Rogers Herndon, all of  whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here.\\n\\nPlease find my forwarding email address, phone numbers, and address.

The ultimate goals of this would include providing tighter two-ways for our traders as well as improving our bottom line.   This would open up opportunity for investing in money markets outside of Canada and the US.   The Swiss Franc rose 5.5% versus the US dollar last week and I think that we are currently missing out on excellent opportunities to increase our income.  I think I could make money at currency trading, and this area shouldn't be overlooked. I understand that a substantial amount of preparation is required before this could happen.

Jim, being an intelligent,\\n financially conscientious person, put the whole $1000 into Nortel\\nNetworks stock. With his $1000, and the transaction cost of\\n $35, he was able to purchase 7 shares at $123 each. Having watched the\\n Nortel stock climb and climb, he felt very good about this investment,\\n happy that he is preparing for the future.\\n\\n John, being a more care-free sort, did something slightly different with\\n his $1000. John borrowed a friend's truck, and proceeded to the\\n  Beer Store, where he purchased 33 cases of beer. John also felt very\\ngood about his investment: 33 cases x 24 = is 792 bottles of beer! John,\\nalso\\n being an intelligent guy, although perhaps not as forward-thinking as\\nJim, calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week, and he\\nwouldn't\\n have to buy beer for a whole year.\\n\\n Jim, of course, was appalled by John's purchase, and berated him\\n constantly about it. As months went by, Jim excitedly watched the\\n stock prices, and saw it start to dwindle. \"It'll go back up\", he'd say\\nto Jim.  Jim, who has been reaping the benefits of his investment\\non a daily basis, would reply, \"Ya, it will.  Hang in there buddy \"burp\".\\n\\n Months went by, and the value of the stock continued to fall, and there\\n was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile. Midwinter came,\\n Jim's stock had fallen to about half of it's original value, and John's\\n beer was about half gone. Jim, being sure that the\\n stock had hit rock-bottom, still was berating John for his frivolous\\n purchase, telling him \"Your beer will be gone in six months! Who knows\\n what my stock will be worth!!\".\\n\\n Well, summer has come, and hard times at Nortel continue. Bad news: Both\\n John and Jim have been affected by the layoffs.  Last week, in order to\\n raise some cash to help through the rough time, Jim sold his 7 shares, at\\n that day's value of $12, and got $84, then after paying the $35\\n transaction fee, he only had $49.\\n\\n Jim stopped by John's house later that day (everyone needs their friend's\\n during rough times), and as luck would have it, there were\\n two bottles of John's beer left. John, being a good, compassionate\\nfriend, offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend.\\n Jim appreciated the gesture, and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot\\nsummer's day, but he felt a bit guilty.\\n\\n \"At least I got fifty bucks back out of it - you have nothing now.\", he\\n said. \"That's ok.\", replied John.  \"Perhaps you can help me, I need to\\n return all these empties.\", he added as his other friend with the truck\\n pulled in. So, they loaded up the truck, and proceeded off to the beer\\n store.\\n\\n Upon arrival at the beer store, they unloaded the empties, feeling a\\n little grim. John went to the counter, and collected his refund for the\\n bottles. \"33 cases x 24 bottles, at 10 cents per bottle, that comes to\\n $79.20\", the friendly Beer Store clerk said to John as he handed him the\\n money. Jim was speechless. Poor guy. Can you imagine  how you would feel\\n if you just discovered that over the course of the\\n last year, your $1000 stock investment left you with $50, and taking same\\n $1000, buying beer, and drinking it, would leave you with $80. I'll leave\\n it up to the reader to come up with they're own \"moral to the story\".\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/214.","Message_ID":" \u003c14678470.1075842032831.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Thu, 30 Aug 2001 16:50:02 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" chris.lambie@enron.com","Subject":" you missed this one","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Lambie, Chris \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Clambie\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nhttp://www.canadatrader.com/trader/result/affich.asp?sid=61XYHJQ2200250\u0026rubno=4000\u0026pa=17\u0026pr=5\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/215.","Message_ID":" \u003c8863966.1075842032854.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Thu, 30 Aug 2001 09:16:29 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" nella.cappelletto@enron.com","Subject":" RE: New Floor Plan","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Cappelletto, Nella \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ncappel\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nThis afternoon is busy for Derek and I but we should be able to squeeze in a few minutes\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tCappelletto, Nella  \\nSent:\tThursday, August 30, 2001 9:49 AM\\nTo:\tDavies, Derek; Le Dain, Eric; Zufferli, John\\nSubject:\tNew Floor Plan\\nImportance:\tHigh\\n\\nGentlemen, as you may be aware, we are looking at replacing the old desking furniture from Smed with new Smed trading desks.

I'm sure you have gotten a \"download\" that sets the context for us to  have a conversation (or two...) over the next little while.  I am  actually flying to Calgary tonight, so I was going to try calling you tomorrow  morning - however, as a trader, would you prefer NOT to receive any calls during  business hours?  If so, when is a good time to be on the phone for  ~25min?  Please let me know.\\n \\nPer your (relayed) request, I have also attached a  current resume.  In addition, I have pasted in some bullet points from a  recent cover letter that outline what I am interested in pursuing and what I  bring to the table.  I'm primarily interested in tapping you for some  energy industry knowledge and a sense of your experiences.  We'll see what  else can happen from there.\\n \\nThanks again for making yourself available and  hopefully we can hookup soon.  Have a great day!\\n \\nAndy Crysdale.\\n \\n \\n \\nWhat I bring to  the table:\\n\\nCapabilities: I have developed a broad set of analytic,  communication and project management skills and experience. I have leveraged  these skills extensively in realising successes as a technology salesperson  and project manager, an MBA student and management  consultant.  \\nCapacity to Learn: Three years ago, I had never heard of  WACC.  I had written a 90th percentile GMAT and was on my was to  Ivey.  In the time since, I have completed the MBA, achieving top marks  in Finance, Marketing and an overall Dean's Honour List standing, I  have taught business courses in Russia, I have worked at two top consulting  firms, consulting on a range of projects in various industries, I have paddled  the Yukon River and my wife and I have bought a house and enjoyed the  arrival of our first child. I am a proactive learner with few  limits.  \\nCommitment: My personal mission statement is to  positively impact people by creating and facilitating positive change.   This core value keeps me highly motivated and interested in being a catalyst  for change.\\n\\n \\nWhat I am interested in  pursuing:\\n \\nStrategic Planning and  Analysis:  Following on what I was doing at Monitor, I'm looking around for  companies that have an active corporate planning/internal consulting  group.  For the prospective employer, I bring a valuable set of skills  and the rigorous, hard-working disposition that is a by-product of the Monitor  pedigree.  For me, an internal planning or consulting group allows me to  keep growing my experience with various businesses or business units in  various industries.  It also allows me to network, learn an industry and,  with the right company, transition into line management in the  future.  \\nBusiness Development: I am also attracted to the  idea of growing a business, primarily because I like generating impact.   I would be interested in \"business development\" roles that combine an element  of selling with involvement in the strategic planning process; basically, the  processes of figuring out what to do and where, and then doing it.  \\nGrowing, Changing Industries:  I am primarily  looking in the financial services, pharmaceuticals and energy  industries.\\n\\n\\n - Andy Crysdale 2001 e-Resume.doc \u003c\u003c File: Andy Crysdale 2001 e-Resume.doc \u003e\u003e \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/228.","Message_ID":" \u003c10986353.1075842033222.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 21 Aug 2001 15:32:58 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" livia_zufferli@monitor.com","Subject":" RE: A quick favour...","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'Livia_Zufferli@Monitor.com@ENRON'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nI don't have a need for traders here in Calgary now.

Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to\\nlease suites for a single day or days.\\n\\nTo be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all\\ncompany details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.\\n\\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to\\nassist.\\n\\nKen Knight\\nPremium Seating Manager\\nCalgary Stampede\\nInfield Suites \u0026 Ranahans\\nPhone: (403) 261-0423   Fax: (403) 264-0299\\nkknight@calgarystampede.com\\n\\n\\nAngela McCulloch\\nEnron Canada Corp.\\nPhone: (403) 974-6738\\n     Fax: (403) 974-6991\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/246.","Message_ID":" \u003c14603743.1075842033647.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 13 Aug 2001 09:35:12 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" mike.grigsby@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Lavo","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Grigsby, Mike \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mgrigsb\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nThis sounds fine.\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tGrigsby, Mike  \\nSent:\tMonday, August 13, 2001 9:43 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tLavo\\n\\nI had Frank Ermis talk to Cowan about having an open line on our box to you guys.

The two day session however, includes a second day of training on NERC Policy 9 regarding congestion management that may not be overly important to Calgary operations.\\n\\nOATI says that version 1.7 is drastically different from the current software and training is highly recommended.  I was thinking that it would be a good idea to send one of us to the 2-day training session and then that person could pass on the information to the other 3.  I think, by the sounds of it, we would only need to attend one day since the second day deals with the NERC policy for the eastern interconnect only.\\n\\nThere is a training session that runs on October 1-2 in Minneapolis.

It is worth the\\n\u003e read.\\n\u003e \"There I am all alone with my bike. I know of only two riders ahead of me\\n\u003e as I near the end of the second climb on what most riders consider the\\n\u003e third worst mountain stage in the Tour. I say 'most riders' because I do\\n\u003e not fear mountains. After all, our country is nothing but mountains. I\\n\u003e train year-round in the mountains. I am the national champion from a\\n\u003e country that is nothing but mountains. I trail only my teammate, Fernando\\n\u003e Escartin, and a Swiss rider. Pantani, one of my rival climbers, and the\\n\u003e Gringo Armstrong are in the Peleton about five minutes behind me. I am\\n\u003e climbing on such a such a steep portion of the mountain that if I were to\\n\u003e stop pedaling, I would fall backward. Even for a world class climber,\\nthis\\n\u003e is a painful and slow process. I am in my upright position pedaling at a\\n\u003e steady pace willing myself to finish this climb so I can conserve my\\nenergy\\n\u003e\\n\u003e for the final climb of the day. The Kelme team leader radios to me that\\nthe\\n\u003e\\n\u003e Gringo has left the Peleton by himself and that they can no longer see\\nhim.\\n\u003e\\n\u003e I recall thinking 'the Gringo cannot catch me by himself'.\\n\u003e A short while later, I hear the gears on another bicycle. Within seconds,\\n\u003e the Gringo is next to me - riding in the seated position, smiling at me.\\n\u003e  He was only next to me for a few seconds and he said nothing - he only\\n\u003e smiled and then proceeded up the mountain as if he were pedaling\\ndownhill.\\n\u003e For the next several minutes, I could only think of one thing - his\\nsmile.\\n\u003e His smile told me everything. I kept thinking that surely he is in as\\nmuch\\n\u003e agony as me, perhaps he was standing and struggling up the mountain as I\\n\u003e was and he only sat down to pass me and discourage me. He has to be\\nplaying\\n\u003e\\n\u003e games with me. Not possible. The truth is that his smile said everything\\n\u003e that his lips did not. His smile said to me, 'I was training while you\\nwere\\n\u003e\\n\u003e sleeping, Santiago'. It also said, 'I won this tour four months ago,\\nwhile\\n\u003e you were deciding what bike frame to use in the Tour.\\n\u003e I\\n\u003e trained harder than you did, Santiago. I don't know if I am better than\\n\u003e you, but I have outworked you and right now, you cannot do anything about\\n\u003e it. Enjoy your ride, Santiago. See you in Paris.'\\n\u003e Obviously, the Gringo did not state any of this. But his smile did dispel\\na\\n\u003e\\n\u003e bad rumor among the riders on the tour. The rumor that surfaced as we\\nbegan\\n\u003e\\n\u003e the Prologue several days ago told us that the Gringo had gotten soft.\\nHis\\n\u003e wife had given birth to his first child and he had won the most difficult\\n\u003e race in the world - He had no desire to race, to win. I imagine that his\\n\u003e  smile turned to laughter once he was far enough not to embarrass me. The\\n\u003e Gringo has class, but he heard the rumors - he probably laughed all the\\nway\\n\u003e\\n\u003e to Paris. He is a great champion and I must train harder. I am not\\ncontent\\n\u003e to be a great climber, I want to be the best.\\n\u003e I learned much from the Gringo in the mountains. I will never forget the\\n\u003e helpless feeling I had yesterday. If I ever become an international\\n\u003e champion, I will always remember the lesson the Gringo taught me.\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/291.","Message_ID":" \u003c29293306.1075842034748.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 23 Jul 2001 07:10:38 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" robert.hemstock@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Revised Tabors Paper Draft","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Hemstock, Robert \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Rhemsto\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nok\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tHemstock, Robert  \\nSent:\tFriday, July 20, 2001 4:49 PM\\nTo:\tHemstock, Robert; 'wes.green@engageenergy.com'; 'Christopher_Mcdowall@transalta.com'; 'Derekl@encoreenergy.com'; 'garyh@encoreenergy.com'; Zufferli, John; ''Martin.

The problem began at the end of June when coding in enpower was changed for how the delta was reported for put options only. This change to the delta did not carry through to the liquidation values for and as a result the options were liquidating showing a loss instead of a gain. This resulted in large losses in 2nd order because the p/l that could not be explained due to the incorrect liquidations was placed there. The IT group is working to fix the problem which should be done in the next day or two. Until then, Karim and myself will manually reflect the correct liquidations and p/l in the DPR until Enpower is fixed going forward starting with July 18th p/l.\\n\\nKarim and I have figured the p/l adjustment that needs to be made for July and the last day of June. The total adjustment is $1,746,675 as follows:\\n\\nJuly = $1,529,869 (July 1 - 17)\\nJune 29th = $216,806  \\n\\nThe July adj was captured on July 17th p/l. The June adjustment needs to be captured as PMA adjustment. As result of the DPR being incorrect for June against the financial liquidations report, the liq rec should be out of balance by at least the adjustment noted above. An FYI for accounting, the financial liquidations report is reporting the correct liquidations numbers for any financial put options!!! The problem lies within the Enpower portcalc not the Financial liq report and that is why the lic rec should be out of balance.\\n\\nJohn\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/294.","Message_ID":" \u003c1324335.1075842034819.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 17 Jul 2001 15:46:40 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" karim.punja@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Option liq","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Punja, Karim \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Kpunja\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nThe total 2nd order up to and including July 16 is (1,891,851)\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tPunja, Karim  \\nSent:\tTuesday, July 17, 2001 4:35 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tRE: Option liq\\n\\nJohn,\\n\\nI just got of the phone with Postlethwaite and he said we will make the adjustment tommorow morning before the final dpr #'s, the correction should add approx. $1.5 million in P\u0026L.

And to be frank, at this point in time it doesn't quite\\nmeasure up. We feel we'd be jeopardizing the quality of the product to meet\\nthe timeline. And that's not the way we do business. Instead, we've decided\\nto shift the launch to early September 2001. The change will also provide\\nadditional time for participants to prepare, especially during the summer\\nholiday season, and allow for more one-on-one training with individual\\nparticipants as requested.\\n\\nOur technical staff will be contacting you in July, to ensure you can\\nconnect to the system and receive test dispatches.  Also, we will contact\\nyou with a firmer implementation schedule as we approach September.\\n\\nIn the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to contact\\neither myself at (403) 233-6491, or your respective Participant Liaison\\nlisted below.\\n\\nCompany Name:   A-E  Elizabeth Vergara (403) 233-6405\\nelizabeth.vergara@powerpool.ab.ca\\n\\n\t\t\t\tF-Z  Karen Mazuryk (403) 705-8509\\nkaren.mazuryk@powerpool.ab.ca\\n\\nThank you for your cooperation.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nPOWER POOL OF ALBERTA\\n\\n\\nAlastair Stewart,\\nManager, Customer and Corporate Services\\nalastair.stewart@powerpool.ab.ca\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/302.","Message_ID":" \u003c23187933.1075842035007.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 10 Jul 2001 14:31:28 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" kimberly.hillis@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Hedge Summary 7/10/01","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Hillis, Kimberly \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Khillis\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tZufferli, John  \\nSent:\tTuesday, July 10, 2001 3:31 PM\\nTo:\tLavorato, John; Davies, Derek; Milnthorp, Rob\\nSubject:\tHedge Summary 7/10/01\\n\\n \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/303.","Message_ID":" \u003c18433408.1075842035036.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Tue, 10 Jul 2001 14:29:39 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" marcelo.meira@enron.com","Subject":" RE: High 2nd order for deal 638008 - July 6 X July 5","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Meira, Marcelo \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Mmeira\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nThis is not just a July 6 issue.

This initial web site will be on a development system that is not\\nconnected to the active market system.  This will enable participants to log\\nonto the system to become familiar with the screens and user features as\\nwell as receive test dispatches.\\n\\nBeginning the week of July 16, 2001, the Power Pool will turn off the\\ndevelopment system web server and transfer to the active market system.  The\\nSystem Controller area will contact each participant and \"walk you through\"\\nthe screens and answer any questions that you may have regarding use of the\\nsystem.  Once you are familiar with the system through this conversation,\\nfuture active dispatches will then be provided over the ADMS system.  The\\nsequential addition of participants to the system will enable the orderly\\ntransfer from the voice dispatch process to the automated process with a\\nminimum of disruption in the dispatch process.\\n\\nThe above process changes the manner in which training will be provided.  In\\nreviewing the user screens, we believe that participants will be able to\\nunderstand how to use the system simply by having access to the system prior\\nto the implementation.  If there is any difficulties encountered using the\\nsystem, the System Controllers will be available to assist you with any\\nquestions as your users begin to use the dispatch system.\\n\\nThe majority of you have indicated that your computer equipment is in place\\nand that you are ready to start implementation.  If you are unable to start\\nthe implementation process on July 2, 2001, please let the Power Pool\\ncontact know and he will arrange to schedule your user names, passwords and\\naccess closer to July 16, 2001.\\n\\nThe implementation of digital certificates to enhance the security of the\\nsystem will be delayed for a short period of time to enable a newer and\\nsimpler digital certificate system.  We believe that by implementing without\\nthe digital certificates, fewer implementation problems will be encountered\\nand will also simplify the digital certificate installation process with\\nusers at a later date.  Our implementation of username and password\\nprotection combined with server certification provides adequate security in\\nthe short term before the digital certificates are incorporated.\\n\\nAs we discussed, the system provides audible alerts for the users when a\\ndispatch is received.  I am attaching six files that contains audible alert\\nsounds for you to load on your computers.  To install these .wav files on\\nyour computers, create a folder\\n\t\t\tC:\\\\PPOA\\admin_sounds\\nand copy these files to the new folder.  Your internet browser will then use\\nthese files for the audible alerts that are provided by the system.  You can\\nreview this with the person who will be contacting you with usernames and\\npasswords if there is difficulty implementing these alert sounds.\\n\\nAs the implementation portion of the ADMS project moves to the operational\\narea of the Power Pool, contact points with the Power Pool will change.\\nEffective immediately, would you please use the following contact names for\\nwork on the ADMS implementation.\\n\\n\t\tPrimary contact:\\n\t\t\t\tJack Kelly\\n\t\t\t\t(403) 233-6410\\n\t\t\t\tjack.kelly@powerpool.ab.ca\\n\u003cmailto:jack.kelly@powerpool.ab.ca\u003e\\n\\n\t\tSecondary contact:\\n\t\t\t\tJerry Mossing\\n\t\t\t\t(403) 233-6409\\n\t\t\t\tjerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca\\n\u003cmailto:jerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca\u003e\\n\\nThank you very much for your cooperation in getting this system underway.\\n\\nBarry Rushford\\n\\n \u003c\u003cdirective.wav\u003e\u003e  \u003c\u003cenergy.wav\u003e\u003e  \u003c\u003cload_shed.wav\u003e\u003e  \u003c\u003cregulation.wav\u003e\u003e\\n\u003c\u003creserve.wav\u003e\u003e  \u003c\u003cinterchange.wav\u003e\u003e\\n\\n - directive.wav \\n - energy.wav \\n - load_shed.wav \\n - regulation.wav \\n - reserve.wav \\n - interchange.wav \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/317.","Message_ID":" \u003c10166616.1075842035433.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Fri, 29 Jun 2001 08:47:32 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" bill.greenizan@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Ancillary Services Exchange Customer Document-Version 1","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Greenizan, Bill \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bgreeni\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"Doug Andrews\" \u003ccfar@attglobal.net\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tWednesday, June 27, 2001 11:44 AM\\nTo:\tVaughn Bend; Roger Thomey; Roger Drury; robert mahan; Rob Imbeau; Hemstock, Robert; Rick Funk; Richard Stout; Richard Hornowski; Renee Usselman; Renata Kurschner; Peter Schubert; Peter Karl; Murray Samuel; Murray Nelson; Mike Filippelli; Marvin Mah; Martin Merritt; Luciano Dalla-Longa; Kris Olsen; Kevin Kohler; Kelly Dukart; Kate Graeme; John Speights; Joe Bradford; Jim Pollock; Jim Oosterbaan; Janine Watson; J.

We believe we have been able to accommodate most of the change\\nrequests -- but not all.  We would be pleased to respond to any comments you\\nmay have on the changes as well as those we have not included.\\n\\nThe key modifications from Draft 3 to this Version 1 relate to the\\nfollowing:\\n\t1) 3011. and 3209.  Failure to Supply:  Liquidated damages have been capped\\nboth for non-System Events and System Events.  The original context of costs\\nattributable to liquidated damages included WSCC penalties -- the caps serve\\nto limit the total amount of liquidated damages claimed against the failed\\nsupplier.  In addition, the penalties under (b) (i) in both sections have\\nbeen removed.\\n\t2) 204.  Code of Conduct:  This section has been beefed up to provide a\\ndirective concerning any potential market manipulation that could cause WSCC\\npenalties to be applied.\\n\t3) 116.  Mediation and Arbitration Procedure: The Mediation procedure has\\nbeen modified to allow the parties the option of proceeding directly to\\narbitration if they so wish and have applied a finite completion time on the\\nprocess.\\n\t4) Schedule 6, 6000.  General:  Applied direction of applicability of\\nsections to Transmission Administrator\\n\t5) 6004.08  Additional Security:  Due to exposure on liquidated damages,\\nWatt-Ex is requiring that Sellers post security for same within 90 days\\n(this is roughly timed for October trading) unless there is sufficient\\nReceivables to cover.\\n\\nWe would again request your indulgence to review and execute this Version 1\\nas soon as possible.  In this regard, we request that customers complete\\npages 1-3 of the document plus individual Schedule 2's for each Ancillary\\nService Facility and fax a signed copy of pages 1-3 plus the Schedule 2's to\\nWatt-Ex to immediately activate your trading privileges.  Please mail the\\noriginals to Watt-Ex, we will execute and return your file copy.\\n\\nIf there are any outstanding items you wish to have considered/reconsidered,\\nWatt-Ex will accept such written comments for consideration in a future\\nversion of this Customer Document.\\n\\nWatt-Ex is also prepared to provide any of the following documents if it\\nwill assist you in attaining comfort with all the attendant infrastructure\\nsurrounding the operations of the Exchange.

Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.

The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.

We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.  \\n\\nEnron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.  \\n\\nFurther, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.\\n\\nFinally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\nBill\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/333.","Message_ID":" \u003c20391686.1075842036339.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 18 Jun 2001 07:26:56 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" cooper.richey@enron.com, bill.greenizan@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Generator Maintenance Coordination Group Meeting-June 14, 2001","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Richey, Cooper \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Crichey\u003e, Greenizan, Bill \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Bgreeni\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"Ritter, Fred\" \u003cFred.Ritter@eal.ab.ca\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tSaturday, June 16, 2001 10:33 AM\\nTo:\t'charlesm@epcor.ca'; 'Dale Mitchell (E-mail)'; 'David Teske (E-mail)'; 'Doug Heath (E-mail)'; 'Frayne Donaldson (E-mail)'; 'Frits de Kiewit (E-mail)'; 'Gary Hagerty (E-mail)'; 'Gary K.

With the change in leadership we should discuss whether we want to grab disturnal back (solid line reporting) and suggest dotted line to arnold.\\n\\nfyi - his P\u0026L for accounting purposes continues to roll-up to canada. However, for internal mgmt reporting, his p\u0026l rolls up to arnold. \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/336.","Message_ID":" \u003c22448945.1075842036410.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 13 Jun 2001 10:04:17 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" paul.leclair@home.com","Subject":" Contini Leadbeater Personal Guarantee","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'paul.leclair@home.com'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nHere are my comments on the original guarantee\\n\\nMy phone is 974-6749\\n\\n \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/337.","Message_ID":" \u003c13388796.1075842036433.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 13 Jun 2001 08:17:43 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jonathan.mckay@enron.com","Subject":" FW: flood pictures","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"J\u0026J Zufferli\" \u003cjzufferli@home.com\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tWednesday, June 13, 2001 8:43 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tFw: flood pictures\\n\\nHerer are some more.  look at hwy 59 right by our house!!!! love you - jess\\n----- Original Message -----\\nFrom: \"marilee\" \u003cwitless@telusplanet.net\u003e\\nTo: \"J\u0026J Zufferli\" \u003cjzufferli@home.com\u003e\\nSent: Wednesday, June 13, 2001 8:30 AM\\nSubject: Fw: flood pictures\\n\\n\\n\u003e amazingly unbelievably astounding!!!\\n\u003e\\n\\n - FLOOD1.jpg \\n - flood2.jpg \\n - flood3.jpg \\n - flood4.jpg \\n - flood5.jpg \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/338.","Message_ID":" \u003c9483726.1075842036456.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 13 Jun 2001 08:16:08 -0700 (PDT)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jonathan.mckay@enron.com","Subject":" FW: downtown tunnel floods","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Mckay, Jonathan \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Jmckay1\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"J\u0026J Zufferli\" \u003cjzufferli@home.com\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tTuesday, June 12, 2001 3:12 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tFw: downtown tunnel floods\\n\\nCheck these out!

Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P\u0026L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P\u0026L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.\\n\\nIt is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.\\n\\nThe timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/4.","Message_ID":" \u003c4788634.1075842027659.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 6 Feb 2002 09:44:52 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" stephanie.sever@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Canadian Originators","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Sever, Stephanie \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ssever\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nyou should request this from eric ledain or derek davies, they have the current list\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tSever, Stephanie  \\nSent:\tWednesday, February 06, 2002 10:42 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tCanadian Originators\\n\\nJohn,\\n\\nPlease provide the list of Canadian Originators.\\n\\nThank you,\\n\\nStephanie Sever\\n713-853-3465\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/40.","Message_ID":" \u003c21648477.1075842028515.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Thu, 24 Jan 2002 12:45:49 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" jzufferli@shaw.ca","Subject":" FW: 1996 Porsche 993 C4S","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" 'jzufferli@shaw.ca'","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \t\"Edward Chan\" \u003cedwardc38@hotmail.com\u003e@ENRON  \\nSent:\tWednesday, January 23, 2002 3:27 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\t1996 Porsche 993 C4S\\n\\n\\n\\nHi John,\\n\\n\\nThe attached are the pictures of the 1996 Carrera 4S.\\n\\n\\nIf you need more pics,please call us again.\\n\\nEdward Chan\\n\\n_________________________________________________________________\\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\\n\\n - DSCN0108.JPG \\n - DSCN0109.JPG \\n - DSCN0110.JPG \\n - DSCN0111.JPG \\n - DSCN0112.JPG \\n - DSCN0114.JPG \\n - DSCN0115.JPG \\n - DSCN0116.JPG \\n - DSCN0117.JPG \\n - DSCN0118.JPG \\n - DSCN0119.JPG \\n - DSCN0121.JPG \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/42.","Message_ID":" \u003c3506098.1075842028562.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Thu, 24 Jan 2002 08:11:59 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" dawn.doucet@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Tyler Seminuk","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Doucet, Dawn \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddoucet\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nyes i gave him a verbal\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tDoucet, Dawn  \\nSent:\tThursday, January 24, 2002 9:06 AM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tTyler Seminuk\\n\\nJohn, we may be able to do something for Tyler on this issue.

The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.

More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.\\n\\nThe market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  \\n\\nAs a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.\\n\\nPeak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.\\n\\n\\nStaffing and Services\\n\\nTrading\\nOn the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.\\n\\nOrigination\\nThis is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  \\n\\nIT\\nImplementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  \\n\\nLet's get on these issues as soon as possible.\\n\\nOn specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. \\n\\nOffice Space\\nTembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, \u0026 kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.\\n\\nPotential Conflict of Interest\\nI would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power \u0026 gas curves should be restricted.\\n\\nAs time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. \\n\\nThank you\\nGarrett\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tMilnthorp, Rob  \\nSent:\tWednesday, January 16, 2002 6:53 PM\\nTo:\tTripp, Garrett\\nSubject:\tRE: Ontario Update\\n\\nGarrett, I take that these are your mids.

Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really\\ncan't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80%\\nof the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash\\nwith any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this\\nmoney for at least 6 months.\\n\\nb) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal\\nthat Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not\\nbe\\ndone until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a\\njob with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have\\nto move back to the\\nUS since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared\\nthe the new Enron deal) are there.\\n\\nc) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to\\nthe bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a\\nmortgage at\\n4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material\\nenough.\\n\\nd) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank\\nthrough a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying\\nvisa bills does help you a bit in this\\ncategory, but not like a mortgage.\\n\\n\\nHopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the\\nbest solution in the long run.\\n\\n\\n    -----Original Message-----\\n   From:   Livia_Zufferli@Monitor.com@ENRON\\n   Sent:   Monday, January 07, 2002 12:54 PM\\n   To:     Zufferli, John\\n   Subject:\\n\\n   Hi John,\\n\\n   Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was\\n   talking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I\\n   don't\\n   want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just\\n   trying\\n   to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would\\n   never\\n   want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank\\n   at\\n   a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I\\n   can\\n   avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs\\n   and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to\\n   come\\n   up with the $55K for the down payment.\\n\\n   If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a\\n   stable\\n   investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7\\n   years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long\\n   while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing\\n   within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either\\n   way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?\\n\\n   Livia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\\nthe intended recipient (s).

Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.\\n\\nb) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be \\ndone until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the \\nUS since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.\\n\\nc) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at\\n4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.\\n\\nd) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this\\ncategory, but not like a mortgage.\\n\\n\\nHopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.  \\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tLivia_Zufferli@Monitor.com@ENRON  \\nSent:\tMonday, January 07, 2002 12:54 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\t \\n\\nHi John,\\n\\nWanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was\\ntalking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I don't\\nwant you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just trying\\nto explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would never\\nwant to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank at\\na decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I can\\navoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs\\nand other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to come\\nup with the $55K for the down payment.\\n\\nIf writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a stable\\ninvestment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7\\nyears, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long\\nwhile.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing\\nwithin 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either\\nway.

EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.\\n\\n1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. \\n\\n2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.\\n\\nIf the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.\\n\\nJohn\\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/90.","Message_ID":" \u003c25508136.1075842029796.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Wed, 5 Dec 2001 06:22:58 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" lon.draper@enron.com","Subject":" FW: Positions without Sundance","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Draper, Lon \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ldraper\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\n\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tReeves, Kathy  \\nSent:\tThursday, November 29, 2001 8:34 PM\\nTo:\tZufferli, John\\nSubject:\tPositions without Sundance\\n\\n \\n"},{"Directorio":"../../enron_mail_20110402/maildir/zufferli-j/sent_items/91.","Message_ID":" \u003c23829224.1075842029820.JavaMail.evans@thyme\u003e","Date":" Mon, 3 Dec 2001 05:53:41 -0800 (PST)","From":" john.zufferli@enron.com","To":" nicole.laporte@enron.com, paul.dunsmore@enron.com, howard.sangwine@enron.com, :\teric.le@enron.com, grant.oh@enron.com, dean.drozdiak@enron.com, :\tgerry.hrap@enron.com, darren.delage@enron.com, :\tsteven.burnham@enron.com, stephane.brodeur@enron.com, :\tpeggy.hedstrom@enron.com","Subject":" RE: Counterparty List","Cc":"","Mime_Version":" 1.0","Content_Type":" text/plain; charset=us-ascii","Content_Transfer_Encoding":" 7bit","Bcc":"","X_From":" Zufferli, John \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JZUFFER\u003e","X_To":" Laporte, Nicole \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Nlaporte\u003e, Dunsmore, Paul \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Pdunsmor\u003e, Sangwine, Howard \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Hsangwi\u003e, Le Dain, Eric \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Eledain\u003e, Oh, Grant \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Goh\u003e, Drozdiak, Dean \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddrozdia\u003e, Hrap, Gerry \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ghrap\u003e, Delage, Darren \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Ddelage\u003e, Burnham, Steven \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sburnham\u003e, Brodeur, Stephane \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Sbrodeu\u003e, Hedstrom, Peggy \u003c/O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=Phedstr\u003e","X_cc":" ","X_bcc":" ","X_Folder":" \\ExMerge - Zufferli, John\\Sent Items","X_Origin":" ZUFFERLI-J","X_FileName":" john zufferli 6-26-02.PST","Content":"\\nNicole and everyone, I think the directory is i:\\canadian\\energy service\\integrated solutions\\counterparty talks.xls\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \tLaporte, Nicole  \\nSent:\tSunday, December 02, 2001 6:10 PM\\nTo:\tDunsmore, Paul; Laporte, Nicole; Sangwine, Howard; Le Dain, Eric; Oh, Grant; Drozdiak, Dean; Hrap, Gerry; Delage, Darren; Burnham, Steven; Brodeur, Stephane; Zufferli, John; Hedstrom, Peggy\\nSubject:\tCounterparty List\\n\\nGood morning everyone,\\nAs you know we will be calling our counterparties today to discuss the Court Case slated for Wednesday.
